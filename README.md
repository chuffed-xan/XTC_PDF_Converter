This is a very simple browser-based XTC to PDF converter used to create PDFs from XTC files for the XTeink readers.

Instructions:
  - Download the xtc-to-pdf.html file and the pdf-lib.min.js file and save them in the same folder.
  - Open the xtc-to-pdf.html in browser and click "Browse..." to select your XTC File.
  - Click "Convert to PDF" and wait for the pages to convert.
  - Wait a mintue for the file download to start after all pages are converted.

Notes: 
This is designed work in browser - I tested it in Firefox and Chrome on Windows and both worked well. You have to wait a minute for the download of the file after the converting is finished depending on the size of your book - please be patient.

Thank you to Reddit users u/JetSerge and u/ImpossibleEase9120 for steering me towards this solution!
